# requirements.pip
# ================
#
# This file contains the runtime requirements for the project.
#
# NOTE:  If a dependency needs to be available on the deployed server, it
# should be listed here.  If it is only a dev/build-time dependency (e.g. unit
# test tool, documentation builder, etc...), it should be listed in
# devreqs.pip. Keep in mind that when we pull polaris libraries from git,
# they always retrieve the current version.
